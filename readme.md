# MaharteX مهارتكس
### (NuxtJS - VueJs - Vuetify - Pinia)

## Project Description 
#### Mahartex is an electronic platform for skill exchange among Arab youth. The website concept provides users with 500 points upon creating an account, which they can use to learn new skills in programming, English language, or any other field. Points can be earned by teaching a skill the user possesses to anyone on the platform.

##### This website was created during the Ramadan 1445 Hackathon, where my team achieved 9th place.

- **Team Members:** 
  - Majd: Founder, Front End, Team Leader
  - Mohammed Hazem: Co-Founder Front End Dev & UI-UX
  - Mohammed Zakarya: Co-Founder Back End Dev
 
#### We held numerous meetings, delegated tasks accordingly, and I coordinated the backend requirements. My friend Mohammed Hazem handled the design using artificial intelligence tools, which we subsequently modified. We designed all frontend components, and Mohammed Zakarya prepared the API.

#### All pages were made dynamic, and we delivered the final video presentation as the deadline approached. Despite not completing all our initial ideas, we accomplished all this work in just 9 days.


#### Afterwards, we received the 9th place certificate from the [American Arab Society for Education and Development](https://www.aased.org/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%A1%D9%A4%D9%A4%D9%A5), the sponsor of the hackathon.
